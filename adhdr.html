    <h1>ADHD: Comprehensive Research Overview</h1>

    <div class="abstract">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how your brain works. Despite its name, ADHD doesn't mean that you lack attention. It means that it's harder for you to control your attention or direct it to certain tasks. ADHD causes symptoms like difficulty focusing, trouble sitting still and impulsive behaviors. But it also allows you to "get in the zone" and hyperfocus on things you really enjoy.</p>
      <p>It is a psychiatric condition that has long been recognized as affecting children's ability to function. Individuals suffering from this disorder show patterns of developmentally inappropriate levels of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. Although there used to be two different diagnoses of attention deficit disorder vs. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the DSM-5 combined this into one disorder with three presentations: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, or combined presentation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction to ADHD</h2>

    <div class="article-section">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Understanding ADHD</h3>
        <p>ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. People with ADHD have differences in how their brain develops and works. This may cause problems with their attention, ability to sit still, and practice self-control. ADHD can affect children and teens at school, at home, and in friendships.</p>
        <p>The signs of ADHD start early in childhood, but some people don't find out they have it until they're older. It depends on when ADHD keeps them from doing well and when they see a doctor about it. No matter what age people find out they have ADHD, the right treatment can help them do better in all areas of life. Having support from parents, teachers, and friends goes a long way.</p>
        <p>Everybody can have difficulty sitting still, paying attention or controlling impulsive behavior occasionally. For some people, however, the problems are so pervasive and persistent that they interfere with every aspect of their life: home, academic, social and work.</p>

      <h3>ADHD Epidemiology</h3>
      <div class="stat-item">Affects approximately 11% of school-age children in the U.S.</div>
      <div class="stat-item">Symptoms continue into adulthood in more than three-quarters of cases</div>
      <div class="stat-item">Around 1 in 10 kids age 3 to 17 have an ADHD diagnosis</div>
      <div class="stat-item">Significantly higher risk for academic, social, and occupational challenges</div>
      <div class="stat-item">With proper treatment, individuals can be very successful in life</div>

    <h3>Understanding ADHD Across the Lifespan</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="caption">Figure 2: How ADHD symptoms manifest differently across development</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>ADHD symptoms begin in childhood (commonly between ages 3 and 6) and may continue into adulthood. But some people don't get a diagnosis until they're adults. There's no cure for ADHD, but treatments like medications and behavioral therapies can help manage symptoms.</p>
        
        <h4>ADHD in Children</h4>
        <p>Typically, ADHD symptoms arise in early childhood. According to the DSM-5, several symptoms are required to be present before the age of 12. Many parents report excessive motor activity during the toddler years, but ADHD symptoms can be hard to distinguish from the impulsivity, inattentiveness and active behavior that is typical for kids under the age of four.</p>
        
        <h4>ADHD in Adolescents and Adults</h4>
        <p>As individuals with ADHD mature, hyperactivity often decreases but difficulties with attention, organization, and impulse control frequently persist. Adults with ADHD may struggle with time management, organization, goal setting, and employment. They may also have problems with relationships, self-esteem, and addiction.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>

    <div class="article-section">
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Genetic and Biological Factors</h3>
        
        <h4>Genetic Predisposition</h4>
        <p>ADHD is highly genetic. This means your child is born with certain gene changes that cause differences in their brain development (neurodivergence). Often, the gene changes that cause ADHD are passed down within biological families. Kids with ADHD commonly have biological parents or siblings with the condition.</p>
        
        <h4>Neurobiological Factors</h4>
        <p>With ADHD, the frontal lobe of your child's brain is wired in a way that makes it harder for them to use directed attention. Directed attention is the ability to focus on something you don't find very interesting. We use directed attention to plan, multitask and solve problems (executive functions).</p>
        
        <h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
        <p>While genetics play a primary role, certain environmental factors may influence ADHD expression:</p>
        
        <h4>Potential Risk Factors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Premature Birth:</strong> Kids born early may be more likely to have ADHD</li>
          <li><strong>Prenatal Exposure:</strong> Exposure to toxins like lead or drugs during pregnancy</li>
          <li><strong>Brain Injury:</strong> Traumatic brain injuries can sometimes lead to ADHD symptoms</li>
          <li><strong>Low Birth Weight:</strong> Associated with increased risk of developing ADHD</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <h2>Diagnosis and Assessment</h2>

    <div class="article-section">
      <div>
      <div class="text">
        <h3>Diagnostic Challenges</h3>
        <p>There is no single test to diagnose ADHD. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to establish a diagnosis, rule out other causes, and determine the presence or absence of co-existing conditions. Such an evaluation requires time and effort and should include a careful history and a clinical assessment of the individual's academic, social, and emotional functioning and developmental level.</p>
        
        <h4>Diagnostic Process</h4>
        <p>A comprehensive diagnostic exam generally includes:</p>
        
        <h4>Clinical Assessment</h4>
        <p>Complete history including symptoms, developmental milestones, academic performance, and family history. Assessment of functional impairment across different settings.</p>
        
        <h4>Multi-Source Information</h4>
        <p>Input from multiple sources is crucial, including parents, teachers, and when appropriate, the child themselves. Standardized rating scales are often used.</p>
        
        <h4>Rule Out Other Conditions</h4>
        <p>Medical examination to rule out other conditions that might mimic ADHD symptoms, such as hearing or vision problems, sleep disorders, or learning disabilities.</p>
        
        <h3>Special Considerations</h3>
        <p><strong>Adults:</strong> Diagnosis in adults requires evaluation of childhood history as symptoms must have been present before age 12. Adults may have developed coping mechanisms that mask symptoms.</p>
        <p><strong>Girls and Women:</strong> ADHD in females is often underdiagnosed as they may present with more internalizing symptoms rather than hyperactivity.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>

    <div class="treatment-section">
      <h3>Comprehensive Treatment Approach</h3>
      <p>Treating ADHD often requires medical, educational, behavioral and psychological intervention. This comprehensive approach to treatment is sometimes called "multimodal" and, depending on the age of the individual with ADHD, may include parent training, medication, skills training, counseling, behavioral therapy, educational supports, and education regarding ADHD.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="symptoms-grid">
      <div class="symptom-category">
        <h4>Medication Management</h4>
        <p><strong>Stimulants:</strong> Methylphenidate and amphetamine-based medications - most commonly prescribed</p>
